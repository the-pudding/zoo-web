Throughout the day each day, a script runs, launching a headless browser using <a href=https://github.com/microsoft/playwright>Microsoft Playwright</a>. This browser navigates to each camera, collects 15 screenshots, and leaves the camera’s page to conserve bandwidth for each facility’s website. The screenshots are then rendered into a GIF using <a href=https://github.com/benjaminadk/gif-encoder-2>gif-encoder-2</a>. Due to the automatic nature of GIF creation and the reliance on live streams that we do not personally operate or maintain, you may sometimes see some glitchiness. If you see a consistent issue (like a camera appears to be permanently turned off), please let us know at <a href=mailto:amber@polygraph.cool>amber@polygraph.cool</a>."},{"type":"text","value":"The cameras are arranged on this page based (roughly) on the location of each animal’s natural habitat. Animals with similar natural ranges are grouped together. This may not be completely accurate as some animals (particularly ocean-dwelling animals) have very large natural ranges and some zoo and aquarium exhibits showcase multiple species with slightly different natural ranges."}]}
